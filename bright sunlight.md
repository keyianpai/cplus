In the bright sunlight, he caught sight of a terrific shadow/outline of a figure whom he didn't expect to be Yang, his dream girl. And actually he didn't even immediately recognize her at the first sight.

Looking at his left elbow, he saw that there was a big worm enjoying his fresh blood silently, but he didn't squeeze the greedy devil's big belly before it was full and stopped. 

Listening to the noise outside the window, he heard the quarrel between a young couple, but they both began laughing loudly before he felt obliged to give some advice about life.

I saw the news that Citibank would have a campus talk at our school on its WeChat official account.

So I have come here for an interview opportunity. I sent my Chinese resume on your company's website and email a couple of days ago but got no response. I thought maybe it's because Citi is an international company, so I have also taken my English resume here today.  

Well, my name is Jiang Qizhi. I was born on July 16, 1994, in an peaceful countryside. I am currently a last-year graduate student at the School of Computer Science in Fudan University. From 2013 to 2017, I spent four years studying Financial Mathematics at the School of Mathematics and Statistics in  Henan University and got my science bachelor degree there. So, I have a little background of economics and finance and a relatively solid background of advanced mathematics. Although I like mathematics, I don't think I am talented enough to have some great findings in this area full of genius. So, I decided to change my major to IT related subject. Because I studied hard and had a good rank in my major, finally I got the qualification of being a graduate candidate at the School of Computer Science in Fudan University without examination. Over the last 2 and a  half years, I have been studying computer technology under the supervision of professor Zhou. Since my research area is privacy preservation, my daily work is to read related thesis and propose novel solutions. In addition to general literature reading, I also perform programming to  implement new ideas, or to validate existing algorithms in the literature. I am a **self-starter**, my advisor values my   diligence and initiative in a varied of situations. And I expect to graduate from here next year if everything goes right.



Just a few years ago when I was younger, I thought that I have the ability to see through a person's heart, that is, I could understood the joy and sorrow and jealousy and hatred and kind silently going on in their little heart. I acknowledged my ignorance after many times introspections afterwards and realizing that those emotions quietly and secretly happened in my heart were actually not fully recognized by myself immediately.



Preserving Differential Privacy in Degree-Correlation based Graph Generation

Enabling accurate analysis of social network data while preserving differential privacy has been challenging since graph features such as cluster coefficient often have high sensitivity, which is different from traditional aggregate functions (e.g., count and sum) on tabular data. In this paper, we study the problem of enforcing edge differential privacy in graph generation. The idea is to enforce differential privacy on graph model parameters learned from the original network and then generate the graphs for releasing using the graph model with the private parameters. In particular, we develop a differential privacy preserving graph generator based on the dK-graph generation model. We first derive from the original graph various parameters (i.e., degree correlations) used in the dK-graph model, then enforce edge differential privacy on the learned parameters, and finally use the dK-graph model with the perturbed parameters to generate graphs. For the 2K-graph model, we enforce the edge differential privacy by calibrating noise based on the smooth sensitivity, rather than the global sensitivity. By doing this, we achieve the strict differential privacy guarantee with smaller magnitude noise. We conduct experiments on four real networks and compare the performance of our private dK-graph models with the stochastic Kronecker graph generation model in terms of utility and privacy tradeoff. Empirical evaluations show the developed private dK-graph generation models significantly outperform the approach based on the stochastic Kronecker generation model.

Enabling accurate analysis of human genetic data while preserving participants' privacy has been challenging since the intrinsic sensitive and high dimensional characteristics of a person's genotype profiles. In this paper, we study the problem of enforcing DP in subpopulation partitioning task. The idea is to enforce DP in the process of dimensionality reduction step on genetic data and then partition the population into several subpopulations using a clustering algorithm. Concretely, we developed a general privacy-preserving framework PSP.
